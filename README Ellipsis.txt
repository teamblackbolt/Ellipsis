Ellipsis UI 1.2 for XBMC Media Center 
=====================================

Please Note: We recommend the very latest builds of XBMC for use with Ellipsis.

----------------------------
About Ellipsis
==============

Ellipsis is a Graphical User Interface for XBMC Media Center, a media playback application available on Xbox, PC, Mac & Linux. To find out more about XBMC Media Center click here.

Our aim with Ellipsis is to make the navigation and use of XBMC as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can. Hopefully we have achieved this goal.

Supporting the latest media center additions, such as full library support, fanart and media flags, We think you will enjoy what ellipsis has to offer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install and use Ellipsis using XBMC:
====================================

Copy the Ellipsis folder that is found in the zip file to your XBMC/addons/ directory. 
This folder may be different depending where you installed to. When you have copied it 
over go to the Appearance Options and in the Skin selection window, choose Ellipsis.

-------------------------------------------------
Upgrading previous Ellipsis versions to a newer one:
=================================================

Do NOT overwrite Ellipsis, many files change and leaving old files will result in adverse
effects. Make sure you fully delete your Ellipsis folder from XBMC/addons/ and then overwrite with
the new one found in this zip file.
